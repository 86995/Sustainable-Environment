        <h1>Green Map</h1> 
        <p>Green Maps are locally created environmentally themed maps with a universal symbol
         set and map-making resources provided by the non-profit Green Map System. Based on the 
         principles of cartography each Green Map plots the locations of a community's natural, 
         cultural and sustainable resources such as recycling centers, heritage sites, community 
         gardens and socially conscious businesses, as well as hazards and challenges to health 
         and wellbeing. Green Maps have been made in 65 countries.</p>
         <h1>History</h1>
         <p>Green Maps are an educational and environmental communication tool for advocacy and
             public awareness first created for New York City by eco-designer Wendy Brawer of
              Modern World Design in 1992 as seen at the Green Apple Map website. The global
               Green Map System was formed as a result of the response to this first Green Map.
                Since 1995, Green Mapmaking has grown steadily around the world.

            The nonprofit first mapping platform debuted in 2009 and has over 41,000 locally 
            charted sites at opengreenmap.org. OGM2, their second platform, is in beta in 2020 
            at new.opengreenmap.org. The Green Map archive at New York Public Library Map Room
             includes 600 printed Green Map editions, copies of all the Green Map books and 
             booklets, along with 300 locally made education and outreach resources made by city
              agencies, non profits, youth and community groups.
            
            
            
            Green Map office in New York City is the resource development, outreach and support 
            center for the movement. Various regions have formed local support networks to help 
            community-led Green Map projects develop and share their outcomes, supported by Green 
            Map System. A 2002 Summit at Bellagio, was a catalyst for hubs that formed in Japan, 
            Taiwan, Indonesia, Europe; an ongoing example is the national Cuban Green Map network.
            
            The website GreenMap.org is the gathering point for both the makers and the users of
             Green Maps. GreenMap.org went online in 1995 and it was re-launched in May 2007, with 
             a resource center for Mapmakers all over the world to communicate and exchange their
              Green Map making experience. This content management system was named the Greenhouse, 
              symbolizing its ability to cultivate and present a “garden of Green Maps”. GreenMap.org
               was relaunched as a story-sharing website when the organization shifted to a Creative 
               Commons 4.0 license in 2018, now all the resources are available at no cost under a 
               Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license with reciprocity from commercial projects.
            
            Although Green Map System authorizes local mapmakers to use its Green Map icons and tools,
             every project is independent and locally led. Grassroots and established non-profits,
              universities and schools, governmental and tourism agencies use the globally designed
               icons and adaptable methodologies to develop and publish their own community's Green 
               Map in a way that meets the needs of residents and visitors. For example, university-community 
               collaborative projects[5] have taken place for twenty years at University of Victoria 
               in British Columbia, Canada, delving into perspectives ranging from First Nations, 
               LGBTQ, and early childhood education.
