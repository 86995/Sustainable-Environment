    <p>Diwali is a pan-India festival and perhaps always on the radar of environmentalists and even courts of law for the ensuing pollution. <br>
        It is true that no Indian can stay away from the festive fervour of Diwali, but air and noise pollution due to firecrackers just<br>
        maybe something to be introspective about.NCAP Tracker, which analyses the Indian government's National Clean Air Programme <br>
        (NCAP), has released a study that found pollution in the first 12 hours after Diwali this year was higher than what it was last year<br>
         in nine out of 11 state capitals where samples were taken.

        NCAP Tracker has said in its report that data for the comparison was taken<br> from Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS)<br>
         of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of the Government of India.
        The state capitals that were included in the analysis werebr<br> Bengaluru, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, <br>
        Gandhinagar, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Mumbai, Kolkata and Patna.
        
        The readings for PM 2.5 (particulate matter) for three days were <br>considered: The day before Diwali, the day<br>
         of Diwali and the day after Diwali.
